    <h3>Project: Assignment 2</h3>
    <section>    
    <p>This project was about creating my first website, as part of my Diploma in Information Technology. The assignment was to build a simple, user-friendly site using HTML and CSS to showcase my skills. The website has three pages: an About page where I introduce myself, a Projects page (this one!) to highlight my work, and a Contact page with a form for visitors to reach out.</p>
    <p>For this project, I focused on using semantic HTML5 elements like header, nav, main, section, and footer to structure the content clearly. I also created a single external CSS file to style all pages, giving them a clean, consistent look. This project ties into my goal to become an IT specialist, where I hope to work with Total ESM, using skills in HTML and CSs. Building this site is a practical step toward that goal, showing I can create functional, well-structured web solutions.</p>
    <P>In the future, I plan to enhance this project by adding interactive features like a working contact form or dynamic content with JavaScript, reflecting my growing skills in IT and my passion for using tech to solve real-world problems like safety compliance.</P>
