    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>Hi, I’m Lucy Bastine, and I live in the south eastern suburb of Berwick in Melbourne, my home. I’ve been married to my amazing husband Mark for 31 years, and we’ve got two wonderful adult children, Brigitte and Harrison. We also have two super cute cats who always keep things fun around the house. Being a Jehovah’s Witness is a big part of who I am, my faith keeps me grounded and guides me every day in the decisions I make.</p>

    <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
    <p>I absolutely love decorating cakes and biscuits! There’s something so special about turning simple ingredients into pretty, tasty treats. Whether it’s for family events or just trying out new designs, it’s my happy place where I get to be creative and share the love. I’ve had the joy of creating biscuits for some really special family events, and two of them stand out.</p>
    <p>One was for my brother and sister-in-law, Peter and Karlie, for their engagement party. I wanted to make something extra special to celebrate their love, so I spent hours designing biscuits with delicate icing patterns, cupcakes, macaroons and a 2-Tiered engamentt cake topped with beautiful roses. I shaped the biscuits round and stamped their names on each biscuit. Seeing their faces light up when they saw the cake table was the best reward, and it made the day even more memorable for our family </p>
    <p>Another event was for my nephew and his now-wife, Zoe, at their engagement celebration. This one was such a fun project! Zoe loves vibrant colours, so I went all out with bold pinks, purples, and golds, decorating biscuits in heart shapes with their initials L & Z stamped on each one. I even tried a new technique with edible glitter to make them sparkle. These moments remind me why I love this hobby—it’s all about bringing happiness to the people I care about. </p>

    <h3>My Future Career Goals</h3>
    <p>I’m working on my Diploma in Information Technology, and I’m super excited about becoming an IT Systems Specialist down the road, hopefully with my current company Total ESM. I’ve been getting hands-on with stuff like setting up networks, messing around with SQL databases, fixing software issues, and learning the basics of cybersecurity through projects like building LANs and securing data.</p>
    <p>Looking forward, I see myself helping Total ESM keep buildings safe with their fire protection and compliance services. With all the new tech popping up in 2025, plus tougher Australian safety rules, I want to be the person making sure their IT systems are rock-solid. I’d love to use my HTML, Java and SQL skills in a practical way to help the business grow and be safe.</p>
    <p>In the long run, I’m aiming to take on bigger roles, maybe leading IT projects that mix tech with safety to make buildings smarter and safer. Working with a company like Total ESM, which is all about using tech to stay ahead, would be the perfect way to make my mark in the safety-tech world. </p>
